# Graphcore® C600

The Graphcore® C600 IPU-Processor PCIe Card is a high-performance acceleration server card targeted for machine learning inference and training. Powered by the Graphcore Mk2 IPU Processor with FP8 support, the C600 is a dual-slot, full height PCI Express Gen4 card designed for mounting in industry standard server chassis to accelerate machine intelligence workloads.

Up to eight C600 IPU-Processor PCIe Cards can be networked together using IPU-Link™ high-bandwidth interconnect cables, delivering enhanced IPU compute capability.

# PopRT

PopRT is a high-performance inference framework specifically for Graphcore IPUs. It is responsible for deeply optimizing the trained models, generating executable programs that can run on the Graphcore IPUs, and performing low-latency, high-throughput inference.

You can get PopRT and related documents from [graphcore/PopRT](https://graphcore.github.io/PopRT/1.3.0/).

Docker images are provided at [graphcorecn/poprt](https://hub.docker.com/r/graphcorecn/poprt).
